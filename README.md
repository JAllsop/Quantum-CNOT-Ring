# Full Stack Quantum Computing - CNOT Ring Simulator
A constructor for a unitary of a CNOT Ring, validated against manual calculations for system unitary.   

The CNOT Ring is a chain of CNOT gates that connect every qubit to its neighbouring qubit where the last qubit neighbours the first [PennyLane Example](https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.templates.layers.BasicEntanglerLayers.html). This circuit template finds application in a suite of quantum circuits known as variational quantum algorithms.

This is a basic use of the Qiskit library that demonstrates some fundamental functions and a few quantum computing principles:
- unitary representation  
- quantum gates and circuits  
- qiskit simulations  

## Requirements:
